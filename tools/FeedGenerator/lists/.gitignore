# git does not allow empty directories.
# Yet, we need to add this empty directory on git.
# To achieve that, we created this .gitignore file, so that the directory will not be empty thus enabling us to commit it.
# Since we want all generated files/folders in this directory to be ignored by git, we add a rule for this.
*
# And then add an exception for this specifc file (so that we can commit it).
